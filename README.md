# Unsupervised text style transfer with monolingual data using back translation

This project is an attempt at text style transfer and machine translation (work in progress) using only monolingual dataset (non parallel sentences). This project is strongly inspired from papers like "Style Transfer from Non-Parallel Text by Cross-Alignment" and "Usupervised Machine Translation Using Monolingual Corpora Only" among other related works. Before we jump into the intro to the project and usage, I would like to emphasize on the fact that this project is not to be considered as an ready-to-use library for translation problems (at least for now). It is a personal project which I work on after my day job, as such, I have not yet tried it on variety of problems or benchmarks.
